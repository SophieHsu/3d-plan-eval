# Integrating Human Field of View in Human-Aware Collaborative #

## Project Overview ##

### Problem ###
Most research on human-AI collaboration assumes humans have full knowledge of their surroundings, 
which is unrealistic.

### Goal ###
Adapt to humans' changing subtask intentions while considering their limited FOV.

### Approach ###
- Integrate FOV into a human-aware probabilistic planning framework.
- Develop a hierarchical online planner to handle large state spaces efficiently.
- Enable the AI agent to explore actions that enter the human's FOV to influence their intended subtask.

### Validation ###
- Conducted a user study using a 2D cooking domain.
- Extended findings to a VR kitchen environment.

### Results ###
- The FOV-aware planner reduced interruptions and redundant actions during collaboration.
- Similar collaborative behaviors were observed in both 2D and VR environments.

### Significance ###
This research addresses a gap in human-AI collaboration by accounting for humans' perceptual 
limitations, potentially leading to more natural and efficient teamwork between humans and AI
agents.
